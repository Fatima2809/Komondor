# Komondor: Release notes

To upgrade Komondor, just download the source code from [https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor](https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor)

## Breaking Changes
* We have changed the way input information is passed to the simulator:
	* The input_system file has been deleted.
	* Additional information has been added to input_nodes file.
	* A new file (/Komondor/Code/config_models) has been added, which defines which general models are used to define the global environment (e.g., path-loss, adjacent channel interference, etc.). These models are typically not modified, but Komondor provides certain flexibility for testing different environmental cases.
