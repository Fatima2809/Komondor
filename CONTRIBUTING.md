# How to contribute to Komondor

### Bug reporting (guidelines)

1) Before reporting a bug, ensure the bug does not exist in Issues.
2) In case the bug has not been reported, open a new issue and be as clear and concise as possible.
3) In addition to information related to the reported issue, include information about the capabilities (e.g., OS, version, etc.) of the device from which the bug was reproduced.
4) Attach log and input files whenever it is possible.
5) Use the following template:

Title: A crash occurs when enabling spatial reuse in large-scale scenarios. 
System: Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bits)
Description: When using the attached input, I noticed a crash (see attached logs) in the simulator. The fact is that the simulation runs properly for the same scenario when disabling spatial reuse.
